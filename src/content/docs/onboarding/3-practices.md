Practices are specific ways that we might enact our values and principles, day-to-day. They may shift and change as the needs of the team and the product demand. There are many different practices that may fulfill a given value or principle. It is always reasonable to suggest a practice may be changed to something else that still fulfills that principle. Being agile means constantly adjusting based on feedback: that includes practices. These particular practices have worked on some OOI teams in the past. That doesn’t mean they’re required. Do with them what you will.

Side note: this is why we often do not subscribe to dogmatic processes like Scrum. The leading philosophy behind Scrum is that teams should adopt a set of given practices, and if they follow them correctly, the team will unlock new capabilities. Instead, we believe in starting from values/principles and deriving practices that fulfill our principles - never starting from practices without a value/principle backing it. Certain scrum practices may in fact be beneficial to the team and fulfill our principles, but we do not subscribe to the idea that we should do a practice “because it is part of Scrum / part of ‘The Process’”. We should always be able to question, and to justify, the WHY behind any practice we commit to. And we should feel autonomy to change / adapt / discard it according to our needs and principles.

## Pair programming

Pair programming supports the principles of **shared context** and **shared responsibility** because when two people work together on the same problem and piece of code, they automatically prevent silos. It also supports **continuous improvement** because engineers working together will naturally learn from each other and grow as a result.

We have no particular rules about pair programming cadence - in conjunction with our principle of **developer trust & autonomy**, we trust developers to pair when it makes sense and solo when it makes sense. Join the `#engineering-pairing-is-caring` channel in Slack to join in for fortnightly (that’s every two weeks!) sessions to encourage pairing across projects.
