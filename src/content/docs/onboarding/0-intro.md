## Philosophy

When onboarding, we always start with Values, Principles, and Practices before getting into the nitty-gritty logistics of tools, resources, ceremonies, day-to-day responsibilities, etc. That’s because values are the foundation of everything we do. Responsibilities change according to the demands of the team and the project, values are constant. These should always reflect what we strive for and what we seek to achieve. Starting with values & principles allows us a shared foundation on which to build specific practices that fulfill our needs. Aligning on shared values is one of the best things a team can do first to come together and build something.

## Process

For onboarding a new team member, we recommend reading the onboarding guide aloud in small discussion panel. After each item, pause for discussion and to ask and answer questions. Edit the documents as you go, if suggestions are made. This is meant to be a living document that evolves with our discipline.
