## Slack

Read our [Slack channel reference](/innovation-engineering/onboarding/6-slack) and ensure you are added to all appropriate channels.

In the [GitHub Slack integration](https://github.com/settings/reminders), check the box for **"Enable real-time alerts for pull requests"**. This will give you notifications when assigned to a PR or when someone replies to your comment, and is necessary for our GH Action PR workflow. 

## Calendar

Read our [engineering meeting reference](/innovation-engineering/onboarding/7-meetings) and ensure you are added to all appropriate engineering meetings.

[Add the calendar](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/open-another-person-s-exchange-calendar-2257f515-408f-48ea-9363-11d0d5848c77) for engineering@innovation.nj.gov.

**Optional tools and add-ons:**
- In Outlook, [disable the setting](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/make-every-meeting-online-70f9bda0-fd29-498b-9757-6709cc1c73f0#os_type=web) that adds a Teams meeting by default to a calendar invite by unchecking the "Add online meeting to all meetings" checkbox
- Install the [Outlook Calendar extension](https://slack.com/app-pages/outlook-calendar) (not available to multi-channel Slack guests)
- Set your default calendar events to [end a 5-10 minutes early](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/end-meetings-early-or-start-late-ebb4c4c9-6992-4ea7-9772-8b5883df8500) and give space between meetings
- If you’re comfortable, grant visibility to event titles on your calendar. Follow [“Change calendar sharing permissions”](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/share-your-calendar-in-outlook-on-the-web-7ecef8ae-139c-40d9-bae2-a23977ee58d5), and change the “People in my organization” setting to “Can view titles and locations”. You can still [mark specific events as private](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/make-an-appointment-or-meeting-private-dc3898f0-22f5-45c6-8cc8-b4d4db84111d).
