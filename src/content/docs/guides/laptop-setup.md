description: Consistent & easy setup and installs

When setting up a new NJ Macbook, use the [nj-laptop-setup](https://github.com/newjersey/nj-laptop-setup) script to keep the setup consistent across machines.

The README there contains all relevant information for how to run the scripts, and what to change (or not).
