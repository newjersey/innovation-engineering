title: Setting up an OOI laptop
description: Consistent & easy setup and installs
---

When setting up a new OOI Macbook, use the [nj-laptop-setup](https://github.com/newjersey/nj-laptop-setup) script to keep the setup consistent across machines.

The README there contains all relevant information for how to run the scripts, and what to change (or not).

Developing on Windows? Follow our [laptop setup guide for Windows](/innovation-engineering/guides/laptop-setup-windows) instead.
