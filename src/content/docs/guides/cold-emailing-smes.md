## 💬 Who we are 

Tip: write “what is this project” and “why are we speaking with you” as a team to be saved and reused. This can be re-used in emails and also at the start of meetings!

### What is the Office of Innovation?

> We’re with the New Jersey State Office of Innovation. Our Office works in partnership with government departments and agencies to improve the State’s development and delivery of policy, programs, and services to residents, businesses, and institutions. We were created in 2018 when the Governor appointed the state's first-ever Chief Innovation Officer to his cabinet. Our mandate is to improve the lives of New Jerseyans, and we do that by using technology, design, data, process, and policy to create more effective and efficient government outcomes.

### What is this project?
> We are partnering with [agency] to identify ways to improve how residents [take action] in order to [acheive outcome].

### Why are we speaking with you?
> To support that effort, we're speaking with you to learn how your unique experience and insights can shape the development of [our outcomes]. We aim to learn more about the challenges you face and patterns you see, so that we can design and implement more effective ways of achieving the best possible outcomes for residents.

## 💡 Tips
- It’s not always easy to do this, YMMV, but one time a mentor of mine gave the advice of: try to avoid yes/no requests in emails. Use “How can we…?” or “What do you propose…?” instead of “Are you able to…?” or “Is this possible…?” or “Does this work…?” The idea is that you want to encourage a dialogue in your request and not just a yes/no response.
- If you’re cold-emailing someone you haven’t met/emailed before, don’t skip the "Why are we contacting you" section: make sure you include who put you in touch with them. Name-dropping the stakeholder who said “oh you should reach out to X with that question” is a good way for them to situate you and your team in the context of someone they already know.
- It’s often useful to specify a virtual meeting. A lot of department partners work in-office and it’s nice for them to know up-front that you’re talking about a remote meeting. Include “on Teams” (for government partners) or “on Zoom videoconferencing software” (for residents / external partners) can help set their expectations correctly.
- Write it once and reuse the same basic email many times. You’ll notice the same copy-pasted intros between the examples below.
- If you’re cc’ing someone they don’t know (like your other project teammates for example), it can be good to call out who they are in the body of the email so that the recipient has context on who else is on the chain. [“My colleagues [Name] and [Name] (cc’ed) and I are…”]
- It’s all about empathy. Re-read your email from the perspective of the person you’re talking to. Did you use an acronym they’re not likely to know? Did you mention someone by name but not include context on their role? _(“I received your contact information from [Name], our team’s program lead...”)_ Look for these things and put yourself in their shoes.
