## Principles of a good wiki

- **Organized** - only contains the information you need, and the information you need is easy to find.
- **Transparent** - anyone can edit it from their first day on the job, and can see documents made by their predecessors
- **Actionable** - documents are not just meant to be read, they’re meant to influence decisions and improve the quality of tasks and projects.
- **Engaging** - wiki docs are far more than words. They are well-formatted, and include images, video, code embeds, and links to related content. They are pleasant to read.

## What belongs in a wiki?

- Document all processes with 3+ steps
- Document anything you’ve repeated 3+ times
- Transfer any Google Doc you've referenced 3+ times

### Document types

Our wiki structure is based on the [Diátaxis framework](https://diataxis.fr/). Specifically, because our wiki is geared towards docs with a clear **application** (not general knowledge acquisition), we use two of their four doc types: How-To Guides and Reference. These are stored in their respective folders.

**Reference docs** should be something that is _consulted_ and act as a source-of-truth for a piece of information. 

**How-To guides** should outline the steps of a process. It is action-oriented: focused on a single task and how to acheive it. Digressions or explanations should be extracted into reference documents.

### Examples

Things that belong in our wiki:
- Synthesized notes, such as a working agreement (reference)
- Static resources, like onboarding docs and code review guides (reference)
- Solidified outcomes that came from decision docs (reference)
- Engineering notes on processes, like "how to set up a demo environment" (guide)
- Technical documentation on specific tools we use (guide)

Things that do not belong in our wiki:
- Meeting notes, agendas, or transcripts
- Real time collaboration like note-taking or comments
- Working documents
